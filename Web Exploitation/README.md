# Web Exploitation

### This folder contains writeups for all the picoCTF 2022 web exploitation challenges. The harder challenges have their own writeups, and the easier ones are put together in [`/Other`](/Web%20Exploitation/Other/README.md).

I will admit that web exploitation is not my strongest suit. Fortunately, the web challenges this year were mostly quite easy (two medium-level SQL challenges were removed during the competition due to bugs).
