# Includes - 100 pts

> Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.

## Solution

Open developer tools and go to Sources. The flag has been split into two parts into `styles.css` and `script.js`.

## Flag

> `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}`

# Inspect HTML - 100 pts

> Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.

## Solution

Open developer tools, and expand the HTML tags.

```html
<body>
  <h1>On Histiaeus</h1>
  <p>...</p>
  <br />
  <p>Source: Wikipedia on Histiaeus</p>
  <!--picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_fd5d57bd}-->
</body>
```

The flag is in a comment tag.

# Local Authority - 100 pts

> Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.

## Solution

Logging in with random credentials, we are redirected to `/login.php`. Open the developer tools and find the `<script>` element. There is a function `filter()` that checks that the username and password are alphanumeric characters. Then, a function `checkPassword()` is called, which is located in `/secure.js`.

```js
function checkPassword(username, password) {
  if (username === "admin" && password === "strongPassword098765") {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

The username and password are hardcoded here. Let's login with those credentials. The flag is displayed in `/admin.php`.

# Search source - 100 pts

>

## Solution

The flag is located in `style.css`, as a comment. Simply Ctrl-F and search the known flag prefix, `picoCTF`.

# Forbidden Paths - 200 pts

> Can you get the flag? Here's the website. We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Solution

Absolute paths are paths relative to the root directory, such as `/usr/share/nginx/html/`. Relative paths are relative to the current directory. Using relative paths, we can move up a directory using `../`.

Our current directory is `/usr/share/nginx/html/`, and the flag is in `/flag.txt`, which is 4 folders above us. Enter `../../../../flag.txt` in the input box, and the flag will be displayed.

# Power Cookie - 200 pts

> Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.

## Solution

Clicking the "Continue as guest" button on the website brings us to a page that says `We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment.`

Open the developer tools, and go to Application > Cookies. There is an `"isAdmin"` cookie with a value of `0`. Let's try changing it to `1` and refreshing the page.

The flag is displayed, as expected.

# Roboto Sans - 200 pts

> The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

## Solution

The challenge title suggests checking the `/robots.txt` file, which is a file commonly found on webpages that tells search engine crawlers which URLs are and are not accessible.

This `/robots.txt` reads:

```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```

Looks like base-64. Converting `anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==`, we get:
`js/myfile.txt`.

Navigate to `/js/myfile.txt`, and the flag is displayed.

# Secrets - 200 pts

> We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?

## Solution

Open developer tools, and go to Sources.

There is a folder called "secret". Let's try navigating to `/secret/` (add it to the end of the url).

We are greeted with "Finally. You almost found me. you are doing well" and a GIF of Chris Pratt.

Let's repeat that step. There is another folder called "hidden".

Now we have a login page. There is another folder called "superhidden".

The webpage now says "Finally. You found me. But can you see me".

Open the HTML in the inspector window, and you will see the flag in an `<h3>` element that has been styled to have the same white colour as the background.
