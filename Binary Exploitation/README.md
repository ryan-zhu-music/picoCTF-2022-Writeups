# Binary Exploitation

### This folder contains writeups for the picoCTF 2022 binary exploitation challenges. The harder challenges have their own writeups, and the easier ones are put together in [`/Other`](/Cryptography/Other/README.md).

Binary exploitation was a new subject to me, so I was not able to solve all of the challenges, but I am more than satisfied with what I have learned just from this year's CTF.
