# Cryptography

### This folder contains writeups for all the picoCTF 2022 cryptography challenges. The harder challenges have their own writeups, and the easier ones are put together in [`/Other`](/Cryptography/Other/README.md).

This year's cryptography category featured some interesting challenges. Most of the challenges used ciphers I was familiar with, but a few in particular taught me some new concepts, such as the Diffie-Hellmann algorithm and Matrix Diagonalization.
