# Reverse Engineering

### This folder contains writeups for all the picoCTF 2022 reverse engineering challenges. The harder challenges have their own writeups, and the easier ones are put together in [`/Other`](/Reverse%20Engineering/Other/README.md).

The reverse engineering challenges this year were relatively easy compared to past years. For some reason, I was unable to get Ghidra to work for last year (unfortunately). A few months ago I decided to try again and it just magically started working (?). Thanks to that, I was able to solve all of the reverse engineering challenges this year.
