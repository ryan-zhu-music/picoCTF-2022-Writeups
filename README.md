# PicoCTF 2022 Writeups

This year's picoCTF CTF event was a success for our team. We finished in the top 0.5%, tying for third with around 20 other teams.

On a personal level, I learned a lot from these challenges and was able to solve much more than last year.

Writeups are provided for all the challenges I solved during the event.

Please do not simply copy my flags and submit them for yourself. Most of the flags have unique identifiers at the end, so a flag for me may not necessary be the correct one for another user. The solutions are the valuable parts!
