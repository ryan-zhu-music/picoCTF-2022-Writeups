## Overview

### Description

> SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`.

BitTorrent is a communications protocol that enables peer-2-peer file sharing (uploading, downloading, etc.).

The [article](https://www.techworm.net/2017/03/seeds-peers-leechers-torrents-language.html) in the hint may be of some use. I am not going to explain the BitTorrent protocol in depth here, but you can do some research on your own.

## Solution

Open the packet capture in WireShark.
Make sure the BT-DHT protocol is enabled: Analyze > Enabled Protocols > BT-DHT

If you look around in the packets, you will find packet 332 contains a movie download. While this is not important, it does give us a clue for what we are looking for. If you search up the `info_hash` parameter, you will find a Pirate site with the movie in the packet. **DO NOT VISIT THE PIRATE SITE!**

The author of the challenge wouldn't include a pirate site as part of the solution.

Let's see if there are any other `info_hash`es for us to find. Apply the filter:

```
bt-dht.bencoded.string == "info_hash"
```

Sure enough, there are more. Looking each of them up, one of them is in fact a `.iso` file, as the hint suggests.

The hash: [`e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e`](https://linuxtracker.org/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e)
